# Hey Coders, I'm Pranay

I'm a Software Engineer always looking for an interesting problem to solve. I specialise in Java and Javascript, Migrating legacy applications and Cloud Services such as AWS.

I'm currently building an application called GTD, a productivity web app based on the principles of the David Allen book called Getting Things Done.
